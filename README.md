# Earth2 Biomes

Welcome in this project repository !

You're someone curious if you are here.
Please don't look at the code quality, I'm neither an expert nor had time to refactor the code ;)



## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
